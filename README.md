Android Auto Apps Downloader (AAAD) is an app for Android Phones that downloads popular Android Auto 3rd party apps and installs them in the correct way to have them in Android Auto. 

For the first time in 3 years, now users with **non-rooted Android devices** can enjoy these apps made for Android Auto, and Android Auto Apps Downloader does it all for you. Simply select an app you want to install on your phone and the download will begin. Once completed, install the given app with the classic Android interface and you can start enjoying the app you’ve just downloaded on Android Auto.

### No need for a PC. 

Android Auto Apps Downloader can be easily installed on any Android phone and the whole installing process is just on the phone.

### No need for developer options.

There’s this common misconception that enabling “unknown sources” or “disable ANR” make those apps work. I don’t know who started this, but it’s totally irrelevant. Debug USB? No need for that either.

### No need of grabbing APK and do manual installations.

Android Auto Apps Downloader will always download the latest version of the software for you. 

### No root needed.

The main goal of this app is having the listed apps in Android Auto with a pain free experience and, most of all, without requiring a rooted phone. If you are rooted, you might want to consider [AA AIO TWEAKER](https://github.com/shmykelsa/AA-Tweaker), which has an alternative root method to patch the apps and it has a lot of other cool features!

Android Auto Apps Downloader is free and offers in app purchases. The free version of the app allows up to 1 download every 30 days. With the PRO version you can enjoy the full experience and download as many times as you want, forever!

# F.A.Q.

### Why the heck do I need this app? Can’t I just install the apps by myslef?

Well yes, you could, but they would not appear in Android Auto. Since the beginning of 2018 the custom apps for Android Auto are blocked by Google, but AAAD installs them in a special way in order to actually see the apps on Android Auto. And no root is needed! Call it magic, if you will.

### I have a warning from Google Play Protect warning me about your app! Is this app a malware?

Of course AAAD it’s not a malware. Google Play Store does not like apps that install other apps and apps that have IAP (in app purchases) not managed by Google. You can see yourself that this app basically doesn’t require special permissions. Also, I’m planning on releasing the source code soon! 

### Why only those apps? Where is YouTube? Where is Netflix? Where is Instagram?

Not all apps are compatible with Android Auto. You can’t just pick an app and sledge hammer it into Android Auto. I’ve included basically almost every Android Auto app known to date, and the only responsibility of AAAD is to make them available in Android Auto. 

### How do I update the apps installed from AAAD?

AAAD will always download latest version of an app. If one of the apps that you've installed through AAAD gets an update, you can open AAAD and download the update. At the moment, there's no update checker, but I'm planning on making it! 

### Will you hold my bank account/credit card informations?

Of course no. The offered in app purchase is solely processed by PayPal and none of the informations are held or shared with me. 

### Will this app be available on the Play Store?

No.

### I have a problem with an app installed by AAAD. Could you help me out?

Any software installed by my app is provided "as is" and I'm not responsible for any malfunctioning. If you are in this case, please seek help from the software's author instead. 

### I have a problem with this app. Could you help me out?

Write an email to help.aaad@gmail.com

### Sir how do I download this app????

If you are on mobile, you likely will have a little dropdown menu named "Assets", from there you can see the package (APK) to install the app. Download and install. If you are on a PC, you might see the "Assets" menu already collapsed and from there you can see the APK.

### PayPal is not available in my country! How can I pay for PRO?

Please write to help.aaad@gmail.com with subject including "NOPP" 

### I don't have the option to open with AAAD from Screen2Auto website

If you are using Samsung Browser to download Screen2Auto you might want to enable "Useful features" in settings of Samsung Browser. Alternatively, just use Chrome. Other browser might not work as well, so please change it. 

### How long will my PRO license last?

The pro license is bond to your device and it will survive uninstallations. If you wipe your device, the device ID will be reset and license will not work anymore. In that case, you may want to contact help.aaad@gmail.com and include in the subject "PROWIPED".
